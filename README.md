# statistical-analysis
Hello world, This repository represents about my earlier code experiences. I was very new to Python and from then still developing my skills day by day. Here some important pandas functions are enlisted. These are necessary for descriptive statistics. Anybody can get help from this file. And now, I want to share my beginning journey with the world. Thank you.
